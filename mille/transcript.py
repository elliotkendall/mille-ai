"""Persistent game transcriptions.

File format: A series of games, each consisting of:
* Game header:
  * One byte number of players
  * For each player, in player number order:
    * One byte: Team number.
    * 16-bit network-order number: Length of player name.
    * Player name.
* For each hand:
    * Six bytes for each player: Initial hand, one card per byte.
    * Or, six 0xFF bytes (just once, not once per player) to indicate no more hands in game.
* For each move in a hand:
  * A 16-bit network-order number:
    * Bits 00-02: Player number of moving player; values of 6 and 7 are special, see below.
    * Bits 03-07: Card drawn.  Value of 31 means no card was drawn (because deck was exhausted.)
    * Bit  08:    Move type: 0=discard, 1=play
    * Bits 09-13: Card played
    * Bits 14-15: Target team (ignored for non-attacks)
  * If player number is 6, this isn't a move, but the remaining bits should instead be interpreted as:
    * Bit 3: The next move is a coup fourre.
    * Bit 4: The player moving next will be declaring an extension.
  * If player number is 7, all other fields are disregarded and there are no more moves in the hand.
